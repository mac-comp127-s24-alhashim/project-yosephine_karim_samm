## Our Inspiration
The inspiration behind our project is based of the Forest App. As a group we'd like to construct a program that tracks a user's productivity through the building of a garden. The garden will consist of various flowers that grow based of the tracked productivity of our user. Once the flower fully grows, its collected in the "Garden", hence the Garden-App! A more concrete reason behind our project is that as students we often face issues in tracking our productivity and efficiency as the semester progresses.This app tries to adress by tracking productivity and assigning a direct reward that represents our hard-work. 

As a group, we'll all focus on building the project and handle all responsibilities together accourding to each outlined deliverable.
