# Garden-Productivity-App
_by:Yosephine Manihuruk, Karim Amra, and Sam Mamicha

## Our Inspiration
The inspiration behind our project is based of the Forest App. As a group we'd like to construct a program that tracks a user's productivity through the building of a garden. The garden will consist of various flowers that grow based of the tracked productivity of our user. Once the flower fully grows, its collected in the "Garden", hence the Garden-App! A more concrete reason behind our project is that as students we often face issues in tracking our productivity and efficiency as the semester progresses.This app tries to adress by tracking productivity and assigning a direct reward that represents our hard-work. 

As a group, we'll all focus on building the project and handle all responsibilities together accourding to each outlined deliverable.

## The Project 
In regard to running the software the requirements for the program are the MyTimer package, java-swing library, and java-awt. The package is responsible for containing the main class, and functionalities of the timer in unison with java swing and awt which allowed us to create a GUI’s for the user. To run the software, the user simply has to run the main class at which  point the program will direct the user to the main window containing all described functions.

Due to the time restriction associated with this project, the project doesn’t have a lot of complexity associated with it and thus doesn’t have any major limitations. One notable limitation is that after the timer restarts, the flower’s progress restarts immediately.
